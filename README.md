**How can we best express the values of community in the new era of the web?**

Today social media platforms offer a distorted expression of community that is more focused on revenue than being aligned with the true values of community. Embrace is looking to change this.
Instead of merely duplicating a Web3 version of these existing platforms, we wish to reconnect to the core principles of community and to start again with fresh eyes.

We are developing a decentralised platform to enable Creators to build communities where they own and can sell their content as well as grow their community base. We aim to bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3 by enabling Creators to channel their existing Web2 subscribers to a platform where they have more control.  This will empower Creatives by allowing them to pool members from multiple platforms into a decentralised community which cannot be censored or de-platformed.
